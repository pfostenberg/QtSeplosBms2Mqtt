SEPLOS BMS V3
=============

First thing. the V3 look like the old but has the following differences. It only look simimlar.

- They use ModBUS Protocol.
- The DIP switches has complete no function
- The have a auto adress assignment!
- You shall only connect the BMS software from them or this software to RS485-1 ( the middle port!) and only PIN 7 and 8 connected ! NO GND!!! 
- The next system must be pluged with a full network cable. going from RS485-2 (#1) to RS485-1(#2) 
- so the wire does the adressen.
- Also there are a lot of telegram on the bus... 
- you adapter should a a 120 Ohm terminating resistor. ( at least so it works stable on my side!)
- some windows systems are detecing a mouse!!! be carefull.
- on my side I use a isolated transmitter.
